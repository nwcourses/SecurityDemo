# Basic Security Demo

- `hittastic`: This is a version of HitTastic! vulnerable to SQL injection and cross-site scripting. In the class you will carry out an SQL injection attack and an XSS attack by the phishing site, below. You will then protect the site. It runs on port 3000.

- `phish` : A simple phishing site, inviting people to "buy music" through HitTastic! However it steals the user's HitTastic! cookies and sends them to the fraudsters' website. Runs on port 3001.

## Installation

`npm install`

This will install dependencies for both sites.

## Starting

`npm start`

Both servers will run concurrently.
